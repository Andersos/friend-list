# Imperative approach:
Currently the most straightforward of the three solutions. Logic for dispatching actions and reading router state is all contained in react components. The most 'imperative' of the examples.

Refer to \*/index.js and \*/containers/FriendSearchView.js for the difference in approach between this example, the 'part-observable-solution', and the 'better-observable-solution'.

## To run
```sh
npm install
npm start
```
